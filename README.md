A simple Python code that I wrote after a few days of trying to understand the basics of Python.
It's nothing special, but since I haven't stepped a single foot into the world of coding, I thought it would be neat.
So far, this code is able to perform basic math expressions using + - / and * {negative numbers also work} 
Working on adding more functions to it later on! :)
