A simple Python code that I wrote after a few days of trying to understand the basics of Python.

It's nothing special, but since it's my very first "project" in python (or coding in general) I thought it would be cool to share it.

So far, this code is able to perform basic math expressions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; it also supports negative numbers! 

Working on adding more functions and a basic GUI to it later on! :)
