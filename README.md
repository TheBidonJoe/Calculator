A simple Python code that I wrote after a few days of trying to understand the basics of Python.
It's nothing special, but since it's the first "project" i ever had in python i thought it would be cool to upload it.
So far, this code is able to perform basic math expressions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; it also supports negative numbers! 
Working on adding more functions and a basic GUI to it later on! :)
